# HabeshaApparel_webapp_project
This is an online apparel-selling web application which will be a marketplace that connects customers with independent fashion designers and small apparel businesses. It will provide a platform for these sellers to showcase their products to a wider audience and for customers to discover unique and high-quality apparel and accessories they may not find elsewhere.
The goals of this traditional online apparel-selling web application are to provide a convenient and enjoyable shopping experience for customers while increasing sales, building brand loyalty, expanding reach, and building a community of fashion enthusiasts.
How do Users Interact with the system:-Since this web application will be developed with a mobile-first approach, it will be responsive, and users who have any device that can connect to the internet can access and use the web application via a web browser using its URL. 
Technology Stack: For the MVP, it will use a tech stack consisting of HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and PHP for the back end and MySQL for database management.
